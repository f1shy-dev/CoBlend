Blender 3x/2.9x scene rendering in Google Colab, now with a fancy, easy-to-use GUI!

### A few notes
1. You'll need a Google account to use this
2. One notebook can only run for a variable maximum time of around 12 hours (24 hours for Google Colab Pro).
3. Eevee rendering is not supported in a virtual machine.
4. Do note that your access to GPU may be limited or blocked by Google, depending on your usage.
5. Have any issues or feature suggestions? Open an issue, or feel free to contribute!

### Disclaimer
Google Colab is targeted to researchers and students to run AI/ML tasks, data analysis and education, not rendering 3D scenes. Because the computing power provided is free, the usage limits, idle timeouts and speed of the rendering may vary time by time. [Colab Pro and Colab Pro+](https://colab.research.google.com/signup) are available for those who wanted to have a more powerful GPU and longer runtimes for rendering. See the [FAQ](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) for more info. In some cases, it might be faster to use an online Blender render farm.
